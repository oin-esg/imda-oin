The Closing the Waste Loop initiative is an R&D programme that was announced in December 2017, along with the Environmental Services Industry Transformation Map. It will support Singapore’s efforts in working towards the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint’s vision of zero waste nation. The initiative is to encourage collaborations with institutes of higher learning, research institutes and private sector partners, to develop technologies and solutions to tackle challenges posed by increasing waste generation, scarcity of resources and land constraints for waste management. The initiative will focus on thematic areas, covering: (1) resource and value recovery from key waste streams, e.g. plastics, food, electrical and electronic products; (2) diversion of ash and residues to conserve landfill space; (3) environmental remediation of closed dumping ground and landfill; and (4) data and analytic driven waste management solutions.
